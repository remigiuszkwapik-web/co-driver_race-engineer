/**
 * Auto-baseline tune calculator.
 *
 * Given a build + three user dials (stiffness, balance, surface), produces a
 * starting-point tune. The output is a seed for the existing /tune diagnostic
 * workflow — NOT a finished tune. Players are expected to drive it, read the
 * damper / load / G-G diagnostics, and refine from there.
 *
 * Storage units are Forza-canonical throughout (lb/in springs, psi pressure,
 * inches ride height, lb downforce, degrees, % for diff/brake, 1–20 dampers,
 * 1–65 ARB). FH6's metric spring slider reads in N/mm and the metric aero
 * slider in kgf — the unit composable handles the display conversion. The
 * frequency-method spring formula goes through N/mm internally; everything
 * else is dimensionless or already canonical.
 *
 * The constants in the CALIBRATION section are starting estimates from
 * suspension physics + community norms. They need verification against the
 * ForzaTune FH6-beta calculator for ~6 representative builds × 3 stiffness
 * dials. Until then, expect outputs to be in the right neighborhood but not
 * tournament-ready.
