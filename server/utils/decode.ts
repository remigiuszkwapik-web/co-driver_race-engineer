 * Canonical telemetry model — the "port" in the ports & adapters design.

 * onto this shape, and everything downstream (bus, recorder, rolling
 * aggregators, WS, client) depends only on this — never on a game's byte
 * layout. The FH6 byte offsets live in server/adapters/fh6.ts; field meanings
 * are documented in DESIGN.md §2.
