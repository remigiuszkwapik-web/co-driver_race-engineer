 * Game registry — the core of the multi-game (ports & adapters) design.

 * (nav gating + the game switcher) and the server (adapter selection).
 *
 * Adding a game is: one entry here, plus — for live data — one adapter under
 * `server/adapters/<id>.ts` mapping that game's wire format onto the canonical
 * `Telemetry` model.
